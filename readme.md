This program is an improvement over the standard Linux `help` utility.
Instead of just printing out a static list of built-in commands with no descriptions, `betterhelp` runs on all files in `/bin` and uses data from man files.
To compile it, just run `g++ -o betterhelp betterhelp.cpp`.

I put my code on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) for no particular reason. Check it out at the CID bafybeigr62hppumueuqtnc5q5glliqpedqa2p3w3t45zdb4re6t5crekde! (If you don't currently have IPFS installed, then you can view it at [inbrowser.link](https://inbrowser.link/)). Just paste the CID.
